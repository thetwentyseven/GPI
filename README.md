# Global Pollution Interface (GPI)

## Introduction

This is a website created by Adrian Vazquez for the module Advance Web Technologies in Napier University, Edinburgh, Scotland.
It is created with a Levinux server, python, bootstrap (HTML+CSS+JavaScript) and SQLite3 database.

This is a web application made for educational purpose where I will try to collect information of pollution from cities around
the world.

## Objectives

The objective of the project is to create a web application with python flask, in a learning environment Linux-based server set-up, called Levinux. We must demonstrate a good level building python flask applications, covering aspects such as routing, URL hierarchy design, static files, request, templates, redirects, responses, templates, sessions, logging, testing, CSS, JavaScript, multiple users, and data storage. Also, I have implemented other technologies like JSON APIs, and AJAX.

## How it works

Once a Levinux environment is running, clone this repository.

  1. Initiate the database with the code `python init_db`
  2. Initiate the web app with the code `python routes.py`

Now on your browser type `http://localhost:5000/` and that is it!
