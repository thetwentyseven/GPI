# Global Pollution Interface (GPI)

## Introduction

This is a web application made for educational purpose where I will try to collect information from cities around
the world and I will make comparisons between the numbers of cars, people, green zones with the pollution level
in a period of time.

This is a website created by Adrian Vazquez for the Napier University, Edinburgh, Scotland.
It is created with a Levinux server, python, bootstrap (HTML+CSS+JavaScript) and SQLite3 database.
